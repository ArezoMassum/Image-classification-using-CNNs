# Image-classification-using-CNNs

This repository contains an implementation of image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with PyTorch. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features

- **Dataset Handling**: Loads and preprocesses the CIFAR-10 dataset with normalization and data augmentation.
- **Custom CNN Model**: Implements a deep convolutional neural network with batch normalization and dropout for better generalization.
- **Training and Validation**: Implements a complete training pipeline with loss tracking and accuracy computation.
- **Data Exploration**: Displays sample images from each class and visualizes dataset distribution.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Analyzes model accuracy, loss curves, and overfitting strategies.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizes learning rate, batch size, and dropout to improve accuracy.
